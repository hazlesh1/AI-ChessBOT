Chess AI Journal:
Planned length of the project: 6 Weeks
Source Code: https://github.com/hazlesh1/AI-ChessBOT 
Date: 2026/02/01
Developer: Leo Girard, (14)
Location: Netherlands Den Haag

Goal:
Setup The environment.
Create the basic Bitboard definition. (64-bit)

Implementation:
A 64-bit integer can hold the state of the board. This will allow parallel processing of moves using bitwise operators. 
 
Key Learning: 
64-Bit Architecture: Deepened my understanding of how a single 64-bit unsigned integer (uint64_t) can represent an entire 8x8 chessboard, allowing for highly efficient move calculations. 
Coordinate Mapping: Mastered the logic for converting 2D board coordinates (ranks and columns) into a 1D index (0-63). 
Bitwise Mastery: Gained practical experience using bitwise operators and the 1ULL constant to isolate and manipulate specific squares on the board.



Funny Facts during this day:
I was listening to the Frieren soundtrack the whole time with my new Denon PerL Pros.

About: 
The project:
This Project was developed using a “Human-in-the-loop” AI workflow.  
Developer:
I have a background in high-level Python development, specifically in creating complex physics simulations (gravity in liquids, collision physics). I chose to build this Chess Engine in C to challenge myself with low-level memory management and hardware-level optimization, concepts I am currently learning through Harvard’s CS50x.
