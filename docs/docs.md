Developer: Leo Girard, (14)
Location: Netherlands Den Haag

Goal:
Setup The environment.
Create the basic Bitboard definition. (64-bit)

Implementation:
A 64-bit integer can hold the state of the board. This will allow parallel processing of moves using bitwise operators.
 
Key Learning: 


Funny Facts during this day:
I was listening to the Frieren soundtrack the whole time with my new Denon PerL Pros. 

About: 
The project:
This Project was developed using a “Human-in-the-loop” AI workflow.  
Developer:
I have a background in high-level Python development, specifically in creating complex physics simulations (gravity in liquids, collision physics). I chose to build this Chess Engine in C to challenge myself with low-level memory management and hardware-level optimization, concepts I am currently learning through Harvard’s CS50x.
